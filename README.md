# DS4300

This is a Readme for our DS4300 repo submissions.

## HW1

The twitter stuff with our basic schema, tweet generator, DB load script (which loads both the followers table and the tweets table -- this is the commented out code in the Twitter.java main method) using our Java API, and the Java API itself.  The timeline grabbing code is the not-commented-out code in the Twitter.java main method.

Analysis.txt includes our Analysis and Reporting section of the assignment, as well as a breakdown of who completed what work.
