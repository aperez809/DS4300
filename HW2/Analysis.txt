1. Device Hardware Configs/ Model Assumptions
Processor  -- 2.9 GHz i5
Cores      -- 4 cores
RAM        -- 8 gb 2133 MHz LPDDR3
Disk       -- 500 GB Flash Storage ( ~200GB available)

Model Assumptions
# of Users
1000
# of Tweets per user
Random 
Distribution of # followers
Logarithmic
  
2. System Parameters Effect on Performance
Our system's specs aren't the strongest in the world, so runnning both the MySQL server as well as our Java API 
program on the same machine definnitely will nnegatively impact our performance.  However, by the same token, since the 
database connection is made to localhost, routing to the DB to connect is simplified and should take (although very marginal,) 
less time.  

Memory constraints shouldn't matter too much for the tweet data load as Java is reading the csv one line at a time, and should 
be garbage collecting along the way.
  

3. Theoretical Best Performance
Writes:
On my machine (with all SSD storage), it takes ~20s real time to both randomly generate our tweets and follower relationships 
and write both of them to disk.  Obviously, this time is significantly improved over our ~5min runtime for our DB insertion 
program.
